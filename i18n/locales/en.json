I worked as a composer and producer for several years, with a musical journey spanning 19 years — from classical conservatory to modern music schools, Jazz studies, and ultimately earning a degree in Music History, Science, and Music Technology. However, faced with limited career opportunities in Spain, I decided to explore a different path.",
